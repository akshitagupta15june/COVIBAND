## Inspiration

To reduce the spread of COVID-19, offices and factories are being required to create an environment in which social distancing between workers and safe work practices are ensured. Solutions based on ultrasonic sensor technology are attracting attention as a means to accurately measure distances between workers.

## What it does

This wearable device will produce an alarm when another person comes in the vicinity(100cm).

## How we built it

Materials required

1) ARDUINO UNO

2) ULTRASONIC SENSOR

3) BUZZER AND LED

4) 9V BATTERY

5) CHARGING MODULE

## Accomplishments that we're proud of

This device will be very helpful for the people who are working in factories and industries to maintain social distance while working even after the post pandemic.

## What we learned

Arduino

## What's next for COVIBAND

We will try to make it more compact.
